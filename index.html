         <div class="courses">
    <h3>Data Structure</h3>
    <p>DSA can refer to multiple distinct concepts depending on the context. In computer science and programming, DSA stands for Data Structures and Algorithms, which are foundational to efficient software development.
 Data structures manage how data is stored and accessed, such as arrays, linked lists, trees, and heaps, while algorithms are step-by-step procedures for processing data, including sorting (e.g., Quick Sort, Merge Sort) and searching (e.g., Binary Search).
 Mastery of DSA is crucial for solving complex problems systematically, optimizing program performance, and succeeding in technical interviews at major tech companies.

In the realm of cryptography, DSA refers to the Digital Signature Algorithm, a public-key cryptosystem standardized by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as part of the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS 186).
 It is based on modular exponentiation and the discrete logarithm problem, enabling secure digital signatures that provide message authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation.
 The latest specification, FIPS 186-5, released in February 2023, prohibits new DSA signature generation but allows verification of previously signed messages, signaling its phase-out in favor of newer schemes like EdDSA.
 OpenSSH has already removed DSA support entirely in version 10.0, effective in 2025.</p>

    <h3>SQL</h3>
    <p>Structured Query Language (SQL) is a domain-specific, standardized programming language used to manage and manipulate data in relational database management systems (RDBMS).
 It was originally developed in the 1970s by Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce at IBM, initially as "Structured English Query Language" (SEQUEL), before being shortened to SQL.
 SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986 and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987.
 It is primarily a declarative language, meaning users specify what data they want rather than how to retrieve it, which contrasts with procedural languages like Java or COBOL.which is designed to perform specific tasks like image recognition, voice assistants, chatbots, and recommendation systems.
 While ANI can match or exceed human performance in narrow domains, it lacks general reasoning, self-awareness, or the ability to adapt across diverse tasks.

SQL is used for a wide range of operations including data query, data manipulation (insert, update, delete), data definition (schema creation and modification), and data access control.
 It operates on structured data organized in tables composed of rows and columns, where relationships between tables are established using primary and foreign keys.
 Common SQL operations include SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and WHERE clauses, which allow users to extract, modify, and filter data efficiently.</p>

         <div class="courses">
    <h3>C++</h3>
    <p>C++ is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language that supports procedural, object-oriented, generic, functional, and modular programming.
 Developed by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs starting in 1979 as "C with Classes," it was renamed C++ in 1983, reflecting its evolutionary enhancement of the C language.
 The language is designed for systems programming and resource-constrained applications, offering high performance, low-level memory manipulation via pointers, and efficient execution speeds, making it ideal for operating systems, game development, embedded systems, high-frequency trading, and real-time simulations.

C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) through Working Group 21 (WG21), with the latest standard ratified in October 2024 as ISO/IEC 14882:2024, informally known as C++23.
 It includes powerful features such as the Standard Template Library (STL) for reusable containers and algorithms, templates for generic programming, RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) for automatic resource management, and support for custom .</p>

         </div>
         <div class="courses">
    <h3>java</h3>
    <p>Java is a high-level, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language designed to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning compiled Java code can run on any platform supporting Java without recompilation.
 It was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and first released in May 1995.
 Java applications are compiled into bytecode that runs on any Java Virtual Machine (JVM), regardless of the underlying hardware architecture.
 The language is known for its portability, security, robustness, and support for multithreading and concurrency.

Java is used across a wide range of domains, including web and enterprise applications, mobile apps (especially Android), big data technologies like Hadoop, scientific and financial applications, embedded systems, game development, cloud-based applications, the Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence and machine learning.
 Its platform independence, extensive standard libraries, and strong ecosystem make it ideal for building scalable and secure software.Despite its complexity and the potential for security risks like buffer overflows due to manual memory management, C++ remains widely used and ranks second in popularity after Python as of November 2024.</p>

    <h3>Express</h3>
    <p>Express.js is a fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js, designed to simplify the development of server-side applications and APIs.
 It acts as a layer on top of Node.js, providing a robust set of features for handling HTTP requests, routing, middleware, and view rendering.
 Express.js is known for its flexibility and minimal core, allowing developers to add only the necessary components through middleware and third-party packages.

It is widely used for building RESTful APIs, single-page applications, and full-stack web applications, and is considered the most popular Node.js web framework.
 Express.js supports integration with various templating engines like Pug, EJS, and Handlebars, and offers built-in tools for managing routes, middleware, and error handling.
 Its lightweight nature and compatibility with JavaScript across both frontend and backend make it a preferred choice for developers seeking speed and control.

Express.js is part of the MEAN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, and Node.js, and is used by major companies such as PayPal, IBM, and Fox Sports.
 The framework is open-source and freely available, with the latest version (5.1.0) being the default on npm, supported by an official LTS schedule</p>
